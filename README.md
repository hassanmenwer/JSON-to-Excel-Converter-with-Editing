The task of converting JSON file data to Excel file was implemented using a web application. The goal of this project is to read and parse the JSON file data uploaded by the user, and display the data in a table containing several columns representing the information contained in the JSON. A "Notes" column was added that the user can modify its contents, and then export the modified data to an Excel file.

First, the user interface was designed using HTML to contain the file upload button, and after uploading the JSON file, the FileReader function was used to read the file and convert it to a JSON object using JSON.parse. The data was then displayed in an HTML table that included all the relevant columns ID, Source, Session ID, Memory Type, Email, Role, Content, Time. The messages were separated so that each message from the user and the bot is displayed in a separate row to facilitate the display of the data.

A "Notes" column was added in the table so that the user can add his own notes to each message. This column is automatically updated in tableData when the contents are modified by the user. Finally, using the SheetJS library (xlsx), the modified data was exported to an Excel file containing all the information with the entered notes.
The technologies used in this project included HTML to build the user interface, CSS to format the page, JavaScript to handle data loading and editing, and SheetJS to convert data to Excel. Multiple challenges were addressed while working on the project, such as ensuring that data was formatted correctly, messages were separated appropriately in the table, and verifying that the uploaded file was a valid JSON file. The results achieved include displaying data correctly in the table, adding editable notes, and exporting the edited data to an Excel file.
